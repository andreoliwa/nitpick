[black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) and [flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) have a line length of 120;\n- ... [flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) and [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) are configured as above in `setup.cfg`;\n- ... [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org) is present as a [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) dev dependency in `pyproject.toml`).\n\n## Quick setup\n\nTo try the package, simply install it (in a virtualenv or globally, wherever) and run `flake8`:\n\n    $ pip install -U nitpick\n    $ flake8\n\nNitpick will download and use the opinionated [default style file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreoliwa/nitpick/v0.21.4/nitpick-style.toml).\n\nYou can use it as a template to configure your own style.\n\n### Run as a pre-commit hook (recommended)\n\nIf you use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) on your project (you should), add this to the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in your repository:\n\n    repos:\n      - repo: https://github.com/andreoliwa/nitpick\n        rev: v0.21.4\n        hooks:\n          - id: nitpick\n\n---\n\nFor more details on styles and which configuration files are currently supported, [see the full documentation](https://nitpick.rtfd.io/).\n',
