Command-line tool and `flake8 <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8>`_
plugin to enforce the same settings across multiple language-independent
projects.

Useful if you maintain multiple projects and are tired of
copying/pasting the same INI/TOML/YAML/JSON keys and values over and
over, in all of them.

The CLI now has a ``nitpick fix`` command that modifies configuration
files directly (pretty much like
`black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ and
`isort <https://github.com/PyCQA/isort>`_ do with Python files).
See the `CLI docs for more
info <https://nitpick.rtfd.io/en/latest/cli.html>`_.

Many more features are planned for the future, check `the
roadmap <https://github.com/andreoliwa/nitpick/projects/1>`_.

The style file
--------------

A "Nitpick code style" is a `TOML <https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>`_
file with the settings that should be present in config files from other
tools.

Example of a style:

.. code-block:: toml

    ["pyproject.toml".tool.black]
    line-length = 120

    ["pyproject.toml".tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
    pylint = "*"

    ["setup.cfg".flake8]
    ignore = "D107,D202,D203,D401"
    max-line-length = 120
    inline-quotes = "double"

    ["setup.cfg".isort]
    line_length = 120
    multi_line_output = 3
    include_trailing_comma = true
    force_grid_wrap = 0
    combine_as_imports = true

This style will assert that:

-  ... `black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_,
   `isort <https://github.com/PyCQA/isort>`_ and
   `flake8 <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8>`_ have a line length of
   120;
-  ... `flake8 <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8>`_ and
   `isort <https://github.com/PyCQA/isort>`_ are configured as above in
   ``setup.cfg``;
-  ... `Pylint <https://www.pylint.org>`__ is present as a
   `Poetry <https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry>`_ dev dependency
   in ``pyproject.toml``.

Supported file types
--------------------

These are the file types currently handled by Nitpick.

-  Some files are only being checked and have to be modified manually;
-  Some files can already be fixed automatically (with the
   ``nitpick fix`` command);
-  Others are still under construction; the ticket numbers are shown in
   the table (upvote the ticket with üëçüèª if you would like to prioritise
   development).

Style Library (Presets)
-----------------------

Nitpick has a builtin library of style presets, shipped as `Python resources <https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlib.resources>`_.

This library contains building blocks for your your custom style.
Just choose styles from the table below and create your own style, like LEGO.

Read how to:

- `...add multiple styles to the configuration file <https://nitpick.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#multiple-styles>`_;
- `...include styles inside a style <https://nitpick.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nitpick_section.html#nitpick-styles>`_.

Quickstart
----------

Install
~~~~~~~

Install in an isolated global environment with
`pipx <https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx>`_::

    # Latest PyPI release
    pipx install nitpick

    # Development branch from GitHub
    pipx install git+https://github.com/andreoliwa/nitpick

On macOS/Linux, install with
`Homebrew <https://github.com/Homebrew/brew>`_::

    # Latest PyPI release
    brew install andreoliwa/formulae/nitpick

    # Development branch from GitHub
    brew install andreoliwa/formulae/nitpick --HEAD

On Arch Linux, install with yay::

    yay -Syu nitpick

Add to your project with
`Poetry <https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry>`_::

    poetry add --dev nitpick

Or install it with pip::

    pip install -U nitpick

Run
~~~

To fix and modify your files directly::

    nitpick fix

To check for errors only::

    nitpick check

Nitpick is also a ``flake8`` plugin, so you can run this on a project
with at least one Python (``.py``) file::

    flake8 .

Nitpick will download and use the opinionated `default style file <nitpick-style.toml>`_.

You can use it as a template to configure your own style.

Run as a pre-commit hook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ on your project, add
this to the ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` in your repository::

    repos:
      - repo: https://github.com/andreoliwa/nitpick
        rev: v0.33.0
        hooks:
          - id: nitpick

There are 3 available hook IDs:

- ``nitpick`` and ``nitpick-fix`` both run the ``nitpick fix`` command;
- ``nitpick-check`` runs ``nitpick check``.

If you want to run Nitpick as a flake8 plugin instead::

    repos:
      - repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8
        rev: 4.0.1
        hooks:
          - id: flake8
            additional_dependencies: [nitpick]

Run as a MegaLinter plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use `MegaLinter <https://megalinter.github.io/>`_ you can run Nitpick as a plugin. Add the following two entries to your ``.mega-linter.yml`` configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    PLUGINS:
      - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreoliwa/nitpick/v0.33.0/mega-linter-plugin-nitpick/nitpick.megalinter-descriptor.yml
    ENABLE_LINTERS:
      - NITPICK
