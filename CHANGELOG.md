### BREAKING CHANGES

* Comma separated values was moved to a different section in the TOML file:

Now:
[nitpick.files."setup.cfg"]
comma_separated_values = ["food.eat"]
* The format of the absent files has changed in the style TOML file.

Before:
[[files.absent]]
file = "remove-this.txt"
message = "This file should be removed because of some reason"
[[files.absent]]
file = "another-useless-file-without-message.cfg"

Now:
[nitpick.files.absent]
"remove-this.txt" = "This file should be removed because of some reason"
"another-useless-file-without-message.cfg" = ""
