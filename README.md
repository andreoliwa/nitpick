Flake8 plugin to enforce the same tool configuration ([flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8), [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort), [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/), [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org)...) across multiple Python projects.

Useful if you maintain multiple projects and want to use the same configs in all of them.

## Style file

A "nitpick code style" is a [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file with the settings that should be present in config files from other tools.

Example of a style:

```
["pyproject.toml".tool.black]
line-length = 120

["pyproject.toml".tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
pylint = "*"

["setup.cfg".flake8]
ignore = "D107,D202,D203,D401"
max-line-length = 120
inline-quotes = "double"

["setup.cfg".isort]
line_length = 120
multi_line_output = 3
include_trailing_comma = true
force_grid_wrap = 0
combine_as_imports = true
```

This style will assert that:

- ... [black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) and [flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) have a line length of 120;
- ... [flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) and [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) are configured as above in `setup.cfg`;
- ... [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org) is present as a [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) dev dependency in `pyproject.toml`).

## Quick setup

To try the package, simply install it (in a virtualenv or globally) and run `flake8` on a project with at least one Python (`.py`) file:

    # Install using pip:
    $ pip install -U nitpick

    # Or using Poetry:
    $ poetry add --dev nitpick

    $ flake8 .

Nitpick will download and use the opinionated [default style file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreoliwa/nitpick/v0.23.0/nitpick-style.toml).

You can use it as a template to configure your own style.

### Run as a pre-commit hook (recommended)

If you use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) on your project (you should), add this to the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in your repository:

    repos:
      - repo: https://github.com/andreoliwa/nitpick
        rev: v0.23.0
        hooks:
          - id: nitpick

To install the `pre-commit` and `commit-msg` Git hooks:

    pre-commit install --install-hooks
    pre-commit install -t commit-msg

To start checking all your code against the default rules:

    pre-commit run --all-files
