Library (Presets)
=================

If you want to :ref:`configure your own style <configure-your-own-style>`, those are the some styles you can reuse.

Many TOML_ configs below are used in the `default style file`_.

You can use these examples directly with their ``py://`` URL (see :ref:`multiple_styles`), or copy/paste the TOML into your own style file.
