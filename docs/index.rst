Flake8 plugin to enforce the same tool configuration (flake8_, isort_, mypy_, Pylint_...) across multiple Python projects.

Useful if you maintain multiple projects and want to use the same configs in all of them.

.. note::

    This project is still a work in progress, so the API is not fully defined:

        - :ref:`the-style-file` syntax might have changes before the 1.0 stable release;
        - The numbers in the ``NIP*`` error codes might change; don't fully rely on them;
        - See also :ref:`breaking-changes`.
